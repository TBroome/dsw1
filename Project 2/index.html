            Every Morning:
        </h2>

        <p>
            Think of a thousand pounds, sitting on your back, at the same time you have a suction cup pulling every ounce of energy
            out of your body. That is the feeling you have every single morning when you deal with depression. There is always that
            weight sitting on you telling you that you are worthless would be better off dead. When you face that fight every day your only thought
            is why today? Why should I get up today? Well MY reason is my daughter and my pets. As silly as it sounds that little fluffy white thing
            sleeping on my back and that crazy 3 year old are what drive me out of bed everyday and that fill my heart with something other then pain.
